The primary objective is to create a beautiful copy of  with a new design, ensuring all UI/UX, multi-page structure, and interactive elements are replicated. The application aims to provide comprehensive information on company pension schemes (bAV).

Key implemented features and ongoing refinements include:
1.  **Core Website Replication**: All essential pages (About, Contact, Privacy, Imprint) and functionalities were implemented 1:1, integrating content from provided documents and legal texts.
2.  **Pflichten des Arbeitgebers Page**: A dedicated page detailing employer legal obligations was added, initially as a list and later restructured into a 3-column, 2-row grid of collapsible elements for compactness.
3.  **Content Adjustments**: Text related to Lohnbuchhaltung was updated to focus on HR systems. Duplicate CTA sections were removed, and the Entlastung für HR-Teams section was compacted into expandable elements.
4.  **Aktuelles Section**: A new page for articles, legal events, and expert opinions was added to the navigation.
5.  **Vorteile / Der Service Page**: A new page for benefits was created, later renamed Der Service and restructured to include Die Herausforderung and Unser bewährter 3-Stufen-Prozess.
6.  **Navigation Reordering**: The main navigation was reordered to prioritize Pflichten des Arbeitgebers, Der Service, and Aktuelles.
7.  **Homepage Restructuring**: The homepage's Warum Arbeitgeber unsere digitale Lösung wählen section was transformed. Initially, original expandable benefit cards were reintroduced above three new interactive blocks (Die Herausforderung, Unser 3-Stufen-Prozess, Unsere Lösung), with a new heading Was können wir für Sie tun?. Most recently, these two main content blocks were converted into side-by-side, large, collapsible elements to save vertical space.
8.  **Visual and Interactive Enhancements**: Micro-animations (hover effects, transitions), improved typography (Inter font, optimized sizes), and a darker, more compact Expertise Section with a prominent orange CTA button were implemented across the site.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing visual and structural refinements based on user feedback.
1.  **Homepage Restructuring**: The primary task was to transform the homepage's main content into a more compact and interactive layout. This involved reintroducing the original 6 expandable benefit cards and retaining the three new interactive sections (Die Herausforderung, Unser 3-Stufen-Prozess, Unsere Lösung). Both these main content groups are now presented as two large, side-by-side collapsible elements, effectively saving vertical space and making content visible only on click. The main title was also renamed from Warum Arbeitgeber unsere digitale Lösung wählen to Unsere digitale Lösung.
2.  **Animation and Typography Improvements**: Across the site, micro-animations (e.g., smooth hover effects, enhanced transitions to 400ms) and typography (e.g., loading Inter font, optimizing font sizes and line heights) were applied to enhance the professional feel and readability. Buttons received shimmering effects and better transitions.
3.  **Employer Obligations Page Refinement**: The Pflichten des Arbeitgebers page was modified to present its 6 obligations not as a vertical list but as a 3-column, 2-row grid of individually collapsible elements, fulfilling the user's desire for a compact block arrangement that saves vertical space.
4.  **Expertise Section Optimization**: The Ihre Experten für betriebliche Altersvorsorge section was made significantly darker () and more compact (reduced padding/margins). The Jetzt beraten lassen button within this section was explicitly reverted to an orange gradient to ensure it stands out as a strong call to action.
